NS_ASSUME_NONNULL_BEGIN

/**
 *  An SQLite data store which ensures safe accesses to the application Core Data layer. In particular, work can be
 *  performed on or off the main thread, without context merging issues. This is achieved by having a single serialized
 *  worker queue process reads and writes in background, while only reads can be performed from the main thread. This
 *  avoids Core Data transaction overlaps (transactions are performed one after the other) and the usual problems related
 *  with context merging.
 *
 *  You should use asynchronous methods when possible. If you want a read to be performed at the same time background
 *  operations are made, you can perform a synchronous read from the main thread. This avoids using a background read
 *  which would have to wait until pending background operations before it have been processed.
 *
 *  Background tasks can be prioritized, butâ‰  for this mechanism to work effectively each submitted task should be short
 *  enough so that the worker queue can move on to pending items fast. Tasks submitted to the main thread should also
 *  be efficient to avoid blocking the user interface.
 *
 *  Credits: The strategy implemented by this class was inspired by the following talk: https://vimeo.com/89370886.
